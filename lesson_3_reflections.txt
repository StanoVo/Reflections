When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - either working on a team project
  - or working from several computers
  - or if I consider Github as a safer place for storing project files than my own computer 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Maybe in case of team projects I wouldn't want to update my local files anytime with others' code, hence face permanent instability.
