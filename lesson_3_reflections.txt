When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - either working on a team project
  - or working from several computers
  - or if I consider Github as a safer place for storing project files than my own computer 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are copies of repository in Github (only). Clones are local copies of repository stored elsewhere - on Github, localy and maybe even on some other computer (if we know repository's URL). Commits (changes) can be synchronized between clones with the help of git commands (push, pull, ...). Branch is always inside the repository, it is other codeline within the project. Branches can be synchronized with the help of merge mechaism (automatically or manually).
