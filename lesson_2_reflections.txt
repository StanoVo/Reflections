What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It is created a "initial git repository", where I can later commit changes in the files. It is simply a first step.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is sort of pre-selection of files, that I want to commit later (I may want to track history of only a small portion of the files in my project). Working dir contains all of the project files. Repository only the files with my commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	With adding corresponding file with the change from working dir to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When I want to keep main branch workable and in parallel work on some experiments, or start e.g. localization into different language.
