How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff helped to see only lines, where is some difference between the files. Hence significantly narrowed the search.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Versioning helps over development period, but especially later in support process to detect and correct bugs, or recall changes provided long time ago.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - versions differs with logic, that I manage. Hence diffs in versions can be meaningful.
    Cons - I may forget to commit and loose a track. I have to care and spend some time on it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for programming versioning, where many times one change menas changes in several files.
    Docs are usually about obe file only.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Gil log for the overall list of individual commits (differences), git diff for detail description of file changes between any commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can quickly revert back to working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For the beginning, probably for android app development courses.
